LUXURY WATCH PRICE ANALYSIS

Dataset from Kaggle
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to analyze and predict the price of luxury watches. Through regression models and clustering, the goal is to identify key factors influencing the price and segment watches into different groups based on their characteristics.

Watch Price Prediction: Identify the key factors that determine a watch's price and develop a Machine Learning model to predict it accurately.

Luxury Watch Market Segmentation: Group watches into different profiles based on their characteristics to improve marketing strategies and product positioning.

Business Applications of the Analysis:

Price Optimization: Determine which features have the most impact on price and adjust pricing strategies accordingly.

Product Segmentation: Identify watch categories based on their attributes.

Marketing Strategy: Design personalized campaigns for each customer segment.

Analytical Approach

Part 1: Price Prediction (Regression) → Machine Learning models to estimate watch prices.

Part 2: Watch Segmentation (Clustering) → Application of clustering algorithms to define market profiles.
